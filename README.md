# GithubSearch
The motto of this project is to Search Github users and display their latest five repositories. <br />
The project is built using Javascript ES6.<br />
This is a GitHub finder where we can search GitHub users by Username and it'll give us their profile, it'll give us all their information, it'll give us a list of their repositories and links to them.<br />
Bootstrap 4 and Bootstrap Swatch is used, which gives you kind of a customized look in terms of colors and fonts.</br> 
If I just type something in if I put a b in, its going to reach out to GitHub using, actually using async/ await, and we're using the Fetch API to get the user from GitHub. Not only is it going to get the the user profile stuff here, but it's going to make another request to get the repositories, the latest 5 repositories.
